Fruit Ninja
The game involves cutting fruits while avoiding bombs. The player starts with three lives, and each time a bomb is cut, one life is lost. The objective is to cut as many fruits as possible to increase the score without losing all lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.

Features
-Random fruit generation: The game randomly generates fruits such as melon, orange, pomegranate, and guava at different positions on the screen. The fruits move diagonally and upward, and new fruits are generated when they move outside the game display.

-Cutting fruits: When the player clicks on a fruit with the mouse cursor, the fruit is "cut" and replaced with a sliced version. Cutting a fruit increases the score.

-Bomb handling: If the player clicks on a bomb, one life is lost. If all lives are lost, the game is over.

-Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time a fruit is successfully cut.

-Game over screen: When the game is over (either by losing all lives or by quitting), a game over screen is displayed, showing the final score and prompting the player to start a new game.

Technologies
Pygame library, which provides functionalities for creating 2D games in Python. Pygame allows for handling graphics, input events, and game logic. The code uses various Pygame functions and features to implement the game mechanics, such as displaying images, handling mouse input, updating game objects' positions, and rendering text on the screen.
